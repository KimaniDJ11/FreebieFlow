# Privacy Policy — FreebieFlow

Effective date: 2025-11-09

Thank you for using FreebieFlow. This Privacy Policy explains what information FreebieFlow ("we", "our", or "us") collects, how we use it, when and why we may share it, and your rights regarding your information. FreebieFlow is a progressive web app (PWA) that helps users manage and track free recurring credits from online services.

Please read this policy carefully. By using FreebieFlow, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect two categories of information:

A. Information you provide directly
- Account information: if you create an account or sign in via a third-party provider (e.g., Google), we may store a username, display name, and email address.
- Profile or preferences: optional profile fields, notification preferences, subscription reminders, and any notes you enter in the app.
- Support and communications: messages you send to us (e.g., bug reports, feedback).

B. Information collected automatically
- Usage data: actions within the app (features used, pages visited, timestamps) to help us improve the product.
- Device and technical data: browser type and version, operating system, screen size, PWA install status, service worker information, and IP address (for security and analytics).
- Local storage data: data stored locally by the app in your browser (IndexedDB, localStorage, Cache API) used to keep your offline data and preferences.
- Cookies and similar technologies: small files placed in your browser or cache used to enable core features, persistence after browser restarts, and analytics.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use collected information to:
- Provide, operate, and maintain FreebieFlow.
- Personalize and improve the user experience.
- Send reminders, notifications, and critical service messages (you can control these in settings).
- Diagnose and fix technical issues, and protect the app from fraud or abuse.
- Analyze usage trends to improve features and performance.
- Respond to your support inquiries.

We do not use your data for targeted advertising.

## 3. Local-First & Offline Data

FreebieFlow is designed to keep data primarily on your device where possible:
- Notes, tracked credits, notification schedules, and other primary app data are stored locally (IndexedDB/localStorage).
- Local data may be used to provide offline-first capabilities and to minimize data transmitted to servers.
- If you opt into cloud sync or sign-in, selected data is synced to our servers or a third-party provider (see "Sync & Third Parties").

## 4. Sync & Third-Party Services

If you enable optional cloud sync or sign in with a third-party provider:
- We may store your account data on secure servers and use third-party services (e.g., authentication providers, analytics, crash reporting).
- Third-party providers will have their own privacy policies; we recommend reviewing them.
- We use only the minimum scope of data required from third-party OAuth providers (for example, email and profile name) and will ask for your consent.

## 5. Sharing and Disclosure

We will not sell your personal information. We may share information:
- With service providers who perform functions on our behalf (hosting, analytics, crash reporting). They are contractually restricted from using your information for other purposes.
- To comply with legal obligations or protect rights: in response to lawful requests by public authorities, to defend our legal rights, or to prevent harm.
- In connection with a business transfer: if FreebieFlow is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, data may be transferred as part of the transaction. We will notify you if such a transfer occurs and the choices you may have.

## 6. Analytics, Cookies, and Tracking

We use analytics to understand usage and improve the app. These tools collect aggregated usage data and may use cookies or similar technologies. You may disable analytics where possible via the app's settings, but doing so may reduce our ability to improve the product.

## 7. Security

We take reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information. However, no system is completely secure. If you believe your account has been compromised, contact us right away.

## 8. Data Retention

We keep your data as long as you have an account or as needed to provide services. Local data on your device will remain until you delete it locally or uninstall the app. If you request account deletion, we will remove your account data from our servers and any backups within a reasonable period, subject to legal requirements.

## 9. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including:
- Access: request a copy of data we hold about you.
- Correction: correct inaccurate information.
- Deletion: request deletion of your account and personal data.
- Portability: receive a machine-readable copy of your data.
- Opt-out: opt-out of analytics and marketing communications.

To exercise these rights, contact us at the address below. We may ask for identification to verify requests.

## 10. Children

FreebieFlow is not intended for children under 13 (or higher age if required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have data from a child, contact us and we will promptly delete that information.

## 11. International Transfers

If you are located outside the country where our servers operate, your data may be transferred to and processed in other countries. We take steps to provide adequate safeguards for international transfers, such as standard contractual clauses where required.

## 12. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the new policy with an updated effective date on this page: https://github.com/KimaniDJ11/FreebieFlow/blob/main/PRIVACY.md. Significant changes will be highlighted in-app or via the email associated with your account when feasible.
